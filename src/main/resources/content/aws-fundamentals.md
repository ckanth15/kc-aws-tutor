# AWS Fundamentals

Welcome to your AWS learning journey! This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know to get started with Amazon Web Services.

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It provides a mix of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

## Core AWS Services

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **What it is**: Virtual servers in the cloud
- **Use cases**: Web applications, development environments, data processing
- **Key features**: Scalable, pay-as-you-go pricing

### 2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **What it is**: Object storage service
- **Use cases**: Backup, data archiving, static website hosting
- **Key features**: 99.999999999% durability, virtually unlimited storage

### 3. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
- **What it is**: Managed database service
- **Use cases**: Web applications, enterprise applications
- **Supported engines**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create an AWS Account
